# Agentforce Case Aggregator

Overview

The Case Aggregator is a Salesforce solution built using Flow and Apex that automatically detects similar or duplicate Cases and creates a single aggregate (consolidated) Case to represent the issue.
This helps reduce duplicate case noise, improves agent efficiency, and preserves full traceability to original Cases.
